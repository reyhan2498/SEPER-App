# SEPER-App

## About SEPER

SEPER is an application designed to support developers in making informed decisions about the use of various practices, relying on evidence and experience rather than unsubstantiated claims. The app aggregates and presents evidence documented in published academic research papers, making this information accessible to commercial software engineers who might otherwise face barriers such as:

- **Paywalls**: Access to academic research is often restricted by paywalls.
- **Academic Language**: Research papers are typically written in academic language that may be unfamiliar to practitioners.
- **Information Overload**: Finding trends in the evidence to make an informed decision can require extensive searching, filtering, and reading.

**SEPER** simplifies this process by performing much of the legwork and storing the results in a searchable database, making it easier for practitioners to access relevant, evidence-based information.
