          <h2>About SEPER</h2>
          <p>This App is created to support developersâ€™ decisions about
the use of different practices based on evidence and experience rather than possibly unsubstantiated claims. 
<br/><br/>There is a lot of evidence about claims that are documented in published academic research papers but these are unavailable to many commercial software engineers because: 
<br/>(a) they are behind a paywall, 
<br/>(b) they are written in unfamiliar academic language and 
<br/>(c) it is difficult to find the trends in evidence to make a decision without a lot of searching, filtering and reading. 
<br/><br/>The Ideal is to make this easier for practitioners by doing most of this work and storing the results in a searchable database.</p>
